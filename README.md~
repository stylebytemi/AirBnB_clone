![logo](AirBnBlogo.png)

## DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT - AirBnB Clone
The goal of the project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com/). This platform allows the booking and hosting of shortlet apartments seamless for Unique stays, Experiences, Adventures, and more.

## DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT - AirBnB Clone

Our command interpreter allow us manage the objects of our project:

* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

## PROJECT OJECTIVES

* How to create a Python package
* How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* How to manage datetime
* What is an UUID
* What is *args and how to use it
* What is **kwargs and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function

## Steps:

* Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel

create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.

create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
